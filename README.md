## Added preprocessing pipeline (27-06-24)
- Tested on pilot scale on two samples
- Pipeline takes in Fastq file and outputs counts matrix

## Added new code for different combination of PCA plots (28-06-24)
- In total five combination of PCA plots were added
- From the non subseted no features defined PCA plot the outlying cells were identified and these cells were tracked in all the other plots.

## Completed PCA pipeline on GSE121708 (other mouse dataset) (29-06-24)
- Used the old established pipeline created earlier and adapted the code so that it works with this new dataset.

## Seperated Seurat and Bioconductor Workflow in two different rmd files and generated 10 PCA plots with different combination of parameters and normalization (01-07-24)

## Started the ranked SEG pipeline - Yet to finish it (01-07-24)

## Removed the outlying cells and re-plot the PCA plot (02-07-24)
